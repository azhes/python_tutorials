# Task: Write a Python program that:
# 1. Defines a dictionary that represents a Pokemon with keys: 'name', 'type', 'hp', 'atk', 'spatk', 'def', 'spdef', 'speed', and 'level'
# 2. Goes through the dictionary and prints the stat (hp, atk, spatk, def, spdef, speed) with the highest value

# Step 1: Define a dictionary that represents a Pokemon
pokemon = {}

# Step 2: Go through the dictionary and print the stat with the highest value
highest_stat = 0
highest_stat_name = ''
for stat in pokemon:
    
print()

# Task: Write a Python program that:

# 1. Defines a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a Pokemon with keys: 'name', 'type', and 'level'.

# 2. Defines a function 'find_highest_level' that takes a type (as a string) as input and goes through the list to find
# the highest level Pokemon of that type and returns its name.

# 3. Asks the user to input a Pokemon type.

# 4. Calls the 'find_highest_level' function with the user's input and prints the name of hte highest level pokemon of that type.

# Step 1: Define a list of Pokemon dictionaries
pokemon_list = []

# Step 2: Define the function find_highest_level
def find_highest_level(type):
    pass

# Step 3: Ask the user to input a Pokemon type
user_input = input()

# Step 4: Call the find_highest_level function with the user's input and print the result
print()
